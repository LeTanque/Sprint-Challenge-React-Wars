1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React JS is a javascript framework that allows developers to create user interface designs with components. One of the problems that it solves is cohesion and efficiency across big projects with many individual teams working on different components that tie in together. Another problem it solves is load times by allowing for the creation of single page applications that allow an app to load initially and then take very little time for the user to load within. 


2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
To think in react is to think about a projects structure and implentation in a way that is conductive to how React works. React is designed to be modular, meaning different parts of the UI are broken into components that are interchangeable and reusable. 


3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
The difference between functional and presenational components is, as the description implies, mostly functional components and mostly design components. The idea is that functional components hold most of the logic that powers the functionality of the project while presentational components hold most of the design elements, style sheet references, and markup that house the project and functional components.

The difference between class/stateful components and functional/presentaional components is syntax and state. The differences in implementation are small but when compiled, the differences are great. Class components give the developer access to more tools from React such as state and lifecycle methods.


4.  Describe state.
State is a plain javascript object that is managed within a component and represents the current state of data. When state changes, the component re-renders.


5.  Describe props.
Props are plain javascript objects that get passed to a component. They function kinda like ambassadors for components, passing data from one to the next, allowing developers to connect components in creative ways.
